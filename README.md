Row-Reducer
===========

This is a program written in Python to row reduce a matrix into echelon and then recuced row echelon form



Features:
1. manual row reduction (you choose every operation)
2. displays matrix at every step
3. Displayes the pivots

this was an early program I wrote when learning Python. Hopefully given time I can come back and refactor it and make it better (see issues)
